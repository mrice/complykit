Hi. Welcome to Complykit. I'm just getting started, and trying to get settled into github at the same time.

For now, I'm just plugging in some tips and tricks you might want to know about.

If you are setting up this project with Eclipse, this is the content of the .gitignore file I use in the top of the tree (you regular expression people will probably see improvements you could make--please do so!):

.metadata/
*.classpath
*.project
*.settings/
ck-common/bin/
ck-core/bin/
.gitignore
